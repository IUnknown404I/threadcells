# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.3-alpha] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Localize the authenticated Web UI in English and opt-in Russian with one typed catalog, safe English fallback, Russian plural rules, and a shared global language selector.
- Render authenticated English and Russian Docs from the same manifest-governed Markdown corpus used by the seven-locale public site.

### Changed

- Adopt semantic-version alpha releases such as `v0.3.3-alpha`, with the build-tooling equivalent `0.3.3a0`, instead of incrementing a numeric suffix after `alpha`.
- Normalize localized Docs and README authorities under locale-owned `docs/<locale>/` trees while keeping root `README.md` and manifest sources canonical English.
- Localize first-party navigation, settings, Housekeeping, Inbox chrome, workflow statuses, and product-safe errors without changing API values, reason codes, IDs, prompts, provider output, or durable user/result content.

### Safety

- Keep English as the deterministic default without browser-language detection; changing locale remains a presentation-only browser preference with no backend, workflow, provider, or runtime side effect.

## [0.3.0-alpha.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Make Workflow Composer input durable and idempotent, preserve payloads for restart recovery, and report admitted, queued, duplicate, and recovery states truthfully in the API and Web UI.
- Resume owner-gated workflows from the exact accepted Composer turn, promote queued owner successors across transport-retry races, and keep resource-policy deferrals out of the transport-failure budget.
- Carry owner-gate recovery and stale-sidecar reconnect provenance through the exact synthetic continuation so disk-only RED and runtime replacement cannot strand accepted resident work.
- Atomically fence workflow turns, Inbox transport, provider execution, and writer authority when a terminal exits; reject new executable input to Exited terminals and reconcile stale historical authority without deleting audit evidence.
- Bind unexpected-runtime-exit notifications to the exact workflow cancelled by the atomic exit transition.
- Keep filesystem-intensive Housekeeping plans alive beyond the ordinary Web request timeout, show deterministic plan/preview progress and product-safe errors, and serialize read-only inventory under the canonical Housekeeping lock.
- Initialize the privileged Full Cleanup helper with the runtime account's canonical home and an explicit minimal capability bound for identity, ownership, permission, and signal operations before executing an owner-authorized plan.
- Bind the privileged Full Cleanup helper to the same root-provisioned operator verifier as the Web service and return a safe diagnostic ID for unexpected helper failures.
- Report manual release cleanup without release-admin authority as protected, delete unreadable approved log files without requiring read access, and recover exact interrupted Housekeeping quarantine residue.

### Safety

- Preserve the opposite lifecycle guarantees together: Ready resident terminals remain wakeable, while Exited terminals cannot regain executable authority or block Full Cleanup idle truth.

## [0.3.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Add operator-authorized, all-idle Full Cleanup with active-only release retention, plan fingerprinting, execute-time revalidation, and truthful reports.
- Encode canonical supervisor/developer routing plus retry and escalation failure classes.

### Fixed

- Allow logical deletion of eligible completed sessions while retaining protected cleanup authority, with durable idempotent receipts and explicit lifecycle blockers.
- Preserve durable agent creation order across Home and Agents List/Grid views and refreshes.
- Make Flow removal and configured-directory removal match their actual persistence authority.

### Documentation

- Document Full Cleanup, lifecycle deletion, agent ordering, routing policy, and release behavior across all seven supported locales.
